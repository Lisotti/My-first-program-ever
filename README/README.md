# My-first-program-ever
This a the first program i ever wrote. I was 11 years old (2013) and bored at my grandparent's house, so i asked my dad to donwload Python for me. I learned it on the internet. 
I found the code some years ago traing to find some old mails.
![Original mail, sent it on 25 augost of 2013](Mail.png)
It was made on an old version of Python, (2.x) I dont remember the exactly version.
